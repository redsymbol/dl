dl - fetch remote file for convenient local reading

(That's lowercase "DL".)

dl will fetch a document at a given URI, save to a temporary file,
and then print its local path to standard output.  This behavior
makes dl handy on the Unix/Linux command line for treating remote
URIs like local files.  For example:

 less `dl http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3454.txt`
 xpdf $(dl http://www.cs.harvard.edu/~malan/resources/cheatsheet.pdf)
 emacs $(dl ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/net/internet.text)

dl supports the HTTP, HTTPS and FTP protocols.  It depends on wget
for downloading; thus you must have wget installed.

Error handling: In the event the document cannot be fetched, dl will
emit a warning to stderr, print nothing to stdout, and yield a
nonzero exit code.  You might want to consider whether the invoked
primary command (e.g., "less", "xpdf" or "emacs" in the examples
above) will fail gracefully enough if this happens.

dl is in the public domain.  If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.
